Argus: Your Personal AI Wingman
An AI-powered, multi-platform application that provides a floating chat assistant overlay, designed to work seamlessly across your apps and desktop environment.

üéØ Project Vision
Argus aims to be an ever-present AI companion that enhances user productivity and interaction on any device. By leveraging a floating interface, it provides contextual assistance without needing to switch apps, creating a truly integrated experience.

üèóÔ∏è Proposed Architecture
The project will be built using a modern, multi-platform architecture that promotes separation of concerns and code reusability across different targets (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web). The core logic will be shared, with platform-specific implementations for the UI and system-level integrations.

UI Layer: Contains all user-facing components, built with a declarative UI framework. This layer will be responsible for rendering the chat interface, the floating assistant head, and other visual elements, adapting to the look and feel of each platform.

Domain/Business Logic Layer: This is the core of the application, containing the use cases and business rules for AI interactions, context processing, and feature management. It will be platform-agnostic.

Data Layer: Manages all data operations, including fetching responses from AI services and persisting chat history to a local database. It will use repositories to abstract data sources from the rest of the app.

Platform-Specific Layer: Includes services for managing the floating overlay, handling native permissions (like "draw over other apps"), and accessing system features like the screen reader for context awareness.

üé® Design System
Primary Color: Aqua (#00CED1) - The official Argus brand color.

Theme: Material Design 3 will serve as the foundational design system, ensuring a modern, clean aesthetic that can be customized and adapted for each target platform.

Typography: The default Material typography will be used as a base, optimized for maximum readability in a chat context.

‚ú® Core Features
Floating Overlay Assistant
A draggable chat head that can remain active over other applications on both mobile and desktop.

Smooth animations for expanding and collapsing the chat interface.

Robust window management and platform-specific permission handling.

Modern Chat Interface
A clean, intuitive chat UI based on Material Design 3 principles.

Support for real-time message display and typing indicators.

Markdown rendering for rich, formatted AI responses.

Local & Secure Storage
Use of a local database for persisting chat history securely on the user's device.

Repository pattern to ensure a clean and maintainable data access layer.

Extensible AI Backend
A flexible interface designed to support multiple AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini).

The architecture will allow for easy integration of new AI models and services, including image generation (e.g., Stability AI).

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
A modern IDE (e.g., Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code)

Kotlin (as the primary development language)

Platform-specific SDKs (e.g., Android SDK, JDK for Desktop) as required for your target.

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

Bash

# Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the Project

Open the project folder in your preferred IDE.

Configure the build system for your desired platform target.

Run the App

Build and run the application on an emulator or physical device.

When prompted, grant any necessary permissions (e.g., overlay permission) to enable the app's core functionality.

üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
This project will be developed by focusing on the following key areas:

Foundational Tasks
Real AI Integration: Connect the app to live AI APIs, replacing any placeholder logic.

Implement support for OpenAI (GPT models).

Add integration for Google Gemini.

Incorporate an image generation service like Stability AI.

Enhanced Context Awareness: Enable the assistant to understand the user's current on-screen context.

Develop a robust screen content extraction service.

Integrate OCR capabilities (e.g., with ML Kit) for reading text from images or non-native UI elements.

Implement logic for injecting relevant context into AI prompts.

Advanced Chat Features: Improve the richness and functionality of the chat experience.

Implement a rich text rendering engine (e.g., Markwon).

Add support for displaying images and other media directly in the chat.

Develop voice message input and playback.

Build user-facing controls for managing chat history.

Future Goals
A custom splash screen animation (e.g., a supernova effect).

User-customizable themes and a color picker.

Support for managing multiple, separate conversations.

Cloud synchronization of chat history and settings using a service like Firebase.

üî® Proposed Technology Stack
Language: Kotlin (leveraging its multi-platform capabilities)

UI: A declarative framework like Jetpack Compose / Compose Multiplatform.

Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with a Repository pattern.

Database: A multi-platform solution like SQLDelight for local persistence.

Dependency Injection: A framework like Koin or Hilt (for Android).

Networking: A modern client like Ktor or Retrofit for API communication.

Animations: Lottie for high-quality, complex animations.

üì± Screenshots & Demo
Screenshots and demo videos will be added here as the user interface is developed and the application becomes functional.

ü§ù Contributing
This is a new project, and contributions are welcome. The current focus is on building a solid, multi-platform foundation that is ready for:

Real AI service integration.

Advanced feature development.

UI/UX enhancements and platform-specific refinements.

Performance optimizations.
